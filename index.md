## About

### Xiaoran Zhang 张笑然

I am a first year master student in Electrical Computer Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles. I am currently working as a volunteer research assistant at [The Ozcan Research Group](https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/) lead by Prof. [Aydogan Ozcan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/aydogan-ozcan/). I work closely with Prof. [Yair Rivenson](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/yair%20rivenson/). I obtained my B.Eng. degree with the highest honor (_President Xu Teli's Special Fellowship_) from School of Automation, [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/) supervised by Prof. [Dawei Shi](http://www.escience.cn/people/dshi/index.html;jsessionid=5E27F4F80FFD767E21F2D439C6C9ADAB-n1). I was fortunate to be a Mitacs-CSC visiting student in [Servier Virtual Cardiac Centre](http://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/svcc) at University of Alberta in summer 2018, supervised by Prof. [Kumaradevan Punithakumar](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~punithak/) and Prof. [Michelle Noga](https://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/svcc/team/).

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on developing deep learning-based techniques for biomedical imaging including registration and segmentation. I am also keen on exploring control and optimization problems on biomedical applications.

## News
* I will apply to Ph.D. programs in Fall 2021. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. Thanks.
* **[04/20]** I am constructing my personal website!
