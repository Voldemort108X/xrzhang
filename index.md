## About

### Xiaoran Zhang 张笑然

I am currently a first year master student in Electrical Computer Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles. I am currently working as a volunteer research assistant at [Ozcan Research Lab](https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/) lead by Prof. [Aydogan Ozcan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/aydogan-ozcan/). I work closely with Prof. [Yair Rivenson](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/yair%20rivenson/). I obtained my B.Eng degree with the highest honor from School of Automation, [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/).

You can contact me via [email](mailto:xiaoran108@ucla.edu).

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on developing deep learning-based techniques for biomedical imaging including registration and segmentation. I am also keen on understanding control and optimization problems on biomedical applications.
