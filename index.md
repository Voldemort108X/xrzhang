## About

### Xiaoran Zhang 张笑然

I am currently a first year master student in Electrical Computer Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles. I am currently working as a volunteer research assistant at [The Ozcan Research Lab](https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/) lead by Prof. [Aydogan Ozcan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/aydogan-ozcan/). I work closely with Prof. [Yair Rivenson](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/yair%20rivenson/). I obtained my B.Eng degree with the highest honor from School of Automation, [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/) supervised by Prof. [Dawei Shi](http://www.escience.cn/people/dshi/index.html;jsessionid=5E27F4F80FFD767E21F2D439C6C9ADAB-n1). I was fortunate to be a Mitacs-CSC visiting student in [Servier Virtual Cardiac Centre](http://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/svcc) at University of Alberta in summer 2018, supervised by Prof. [Kumaradevan Punithakumar](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~punithak/) and Prof. [Michelle Noga](https://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/svcc/team/).
